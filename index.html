<p>it‚Äôs funny cause i get different advice depending on who i ask. some people <em>always</em> tell me not to burn out because they‚Äôve seen other people burn out. ‚Äúthere‚Äôs never a limit where you can stop grinding, so it‚Äôs not worth it to chase highs.‚Äù and when i ask others, they tell me, ‚Äúif you‚Äôre struggling with x, read y, just do z, you got this.‚Äù</p>

			 <p>thoughts stir in the night,<br>
shadowing the moon&rsquo;s soft light, <br>
sleep&rsquo;s elusive flight.</p>
<hr>
<p>Lying in bed, you gaze at the ceiling, swaddled in the dark quiet of your room. It&rsquo;s late, the world outside is sleeping, but you&hellip; you are awake. The day has faded away, the bustling sounds of life have quieted, the light has been replaced by the soft glow of the moon. And yet, despite the tranquil vibe, your mind refuses to cooperate. It buzzes, hums, races - it remains immersed in a sea of thoughts that you simply can&rsquo;t silence - it leaves you to drown.</p>
<p>The perpetual storm seems to crescendo during the night when distractions wane, and you&rsquo;re left alone with your mind. Ideas, worries, plans, regrets, fantasies, memories, all whirl in a ceaseless torrent, a kaleidoscope of thoughts that keep you pinned to the present, unable to drift into your dreams.</p>
<p>Each night, you find yourself wrestling with existential inquiries or obsessing over minor details from the day&rsquo;s happenings. Your mind gets ensnared in hypothetical scenarios or rehearses events that have no certainty of occurring. At times, it&rsquo;s as though your consciousness is a stage and each thought a relentless actor, delivering monologues long into the night, refusing to exit and allow for any intermission.</p>
<p>Anxiety and worries become magnified in the quiet of the night, their weight growing heavier with each passing hour. The pressures of the past and the uncertainties of the future vie for attention, the abstract fears seamlessly intertwining with mundane worries.</p>
<p>This is the paradox of your restless mind. At the precise time when you should be winding down, letting go of the day&rsquo;s worries, your thoughts become louder, more insistent. They tug at you, each demanding attention, and keep you from the rest you need. I just want to go to sleep.</p>

			 <p>Among the multitude of names, is mine, echoing through the corridors of time. Will it make a resounding sound, etching itself indelibly into the collective consciousness, or will it die in a whimper?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; - a name carrying the weight of historical religious reverence. ‚ÄúGod is gracious,‚Äù they say. Repeated in lullabies and anthems, whispered in classrooms and shouted in arenas, it transcends. For some it‚Äôs a nickname, but that‚Äôs my name. For me, it‚Äôs never about what they call me, but what I answer to. Call me and I will part the sea for you.</p>
<p>Then, &ldquo;Zeng,&rdquo; a name tethered to deep roots in eastern heritage. It hints at a lineage dating back to the ancient kings of the Xia Dynasty, who did something amazing and probably quite refined, I‚Äôm sure. A tethered line, an unbroken chain‚Äîof royalty.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúWhat&rsquo;s in a name? <br>
That which we call a rose <br>
by any other name would smell as sweet.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚Äï <cite>some dead bard</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Names are for products‚Äîways to remember things easier by or to provide classification. Like the selection of a restaurant menu are the <em>names</em>, but the food items taste delectably different at each location. Names are for people to pattern match on. I wish to be no such structure.</p>
<p>Like tradition, I can‚Äôt fathom why some things must be so unchanging. Not a single Chinese person has ever cared what their ridiculous last name has ever implied. The years of imperialism are over. Your family name means less than the dirt you tread on. I wish I could choose what I stand for, instead of being bound by the dead remembrance of a pathetic ruler. Times change.</p>
<p>Google was originally <em>Backrub</em>. Enough said.</p>
<hr>
<p>Until you get married because then being bound by name is very much more symbolic, beautiful, and meaningful.</p>

			 <p>people suck at choosing side projects for cs for whatever reason (personal, for job apps, for college apps, etc.). here are my thoughts on that.</p>
<p>first there are learning projects and then there are practical projects. the former is stuff like classwork, basic stuff like rubicks cube simulator, or otherwise fodder projects. don&rsquo;t do these. if you really want to do these, i&rsquo;d recommend doing stuff like research or open source software contributions.</p>
<p>instead, choose to make stuff that actually is practical. one good way to measure this is to guess how popular your project will be.</p>
<p>one tip is to pick a niche and make something for it. for example, if you created a pokemon showdown ai, then you&rsquo;d likely get a lot of traction and interest from the community. also the competition is weaker, where basically the best ai atm is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhvj7CmTRkg">this kid&rsquo;s bot</a>. i&rsquo;m sure you could do a better job. you&rsquo;d get a lot more traction, usage, and metrics to show off. i would say this would be a great side project.</p>
<p>another example. this guy made a <a href="https://duiqt.github.io/herta_kuru/">honkai: star rail herta fan website</a> and it is completely memey, simple, but fun. but it still has 80 stars on github and it reaches people on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/comments/13mag83/for_all_my_kuru_kuru_fans_here_is_a_website_where/">reddit</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Seseren_kr">twitter</a>. more reach. and your project has value. in this example, people are used to fan-art, but not silly sites, which makes it perfect.</p>
<p>on a side note i found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-olgZch8sg">this youtuber&rsquo;s project</a> and his crappy startup, <a href="https://www.ratemydorm.com/">ratemydorm</a>. see, again, it&rsquo;s a good project and has lots of traction üëç. just don&rsquo;t ever think a dorm rating project has any traction as a venture-funded startup&hellip; it was good for youtube views, but not much else.</p>
<p>idk thats about it&hellip; i should write more on this later because 93% of side projects seem like regurgitated garbage.</p>

			 <p>space is really cool because it&rsquo;s big. like, really, really big. so big, we can&rsquo;t even begin to truly grasp its size. 93 billion light-years in diameter. expanding at 70 kilometers per second per megaparsec. there&rsquo;s so goddamn much to see and discover in our universe to uncover. stars, galaxies, black holes, dark matter, and mysterious things that are waiting out there for us to find them.</p>
<p>when you look up at the sky, you see light from stars that could be billions of years old. you literally look back in time. it makes you realize just how small your problems can be.</p>
<p>space exploration is really exciting. we&rsquo;ve been to the moon, and now we&rsquo;re going to mars (kinda) and maybe even so much further one day. these missions aren&rsquo;t just cool adventures like a billionaire&rsquo;s random pastime, they&rsquo;re also a way for us to learn more about the universe. every time we send a spacecraft out there, we get lottsa new information that helps us answer big questions. where did we come from? are we alone in the universe?</p>
<p>and then there&rsquo;s the idea of living in space. space-themed video games, books, movies. a fantasy that we could lowkey be a real thing in one day.</p>
<p>but its not just about exploration and big ideas. it&rsquo;s also really important for our everyday lives. without satellites, we wouldn&rsquo;t have things like GPS, weather forecasts, or television, and a bunch of other things (you can google them).</p>
<p>and of course, space is just beautiful, thereotically and practically. in the real world pictures from space missions or telescopes show us immaculate depictions of nature: colorful nebulae where stars are born, galaxies spinning in the vast emptiness, comets streaking across the sky. even just looking at the night sky from earth is breathtaking (as long as you&rsquo;re not in the city).</p>
<p>thereotically, we have beautiful equations that could begin to help us understand how exactly our universe works. my favorite is einstein&rsquo;s field equations from general relativity.</p>
<p>in physics, space is not just an empty space where events happen. instead, it&rsquo;s dynamic and interacts with the matter and energy it contains. this idea is basically captured in general relativity.</p>
<p>einstein&rsquo;s field equations are a set of ten interrelated differential equations that describe how matter and energy in the universe curve spacetime. the curved spacetime, in turn, tells matter and energy how to move. these equations are typically written something like:</p>
<p>GŒºŒΩ = 8œÄG/c‚Å¥ * TŒºŒΩ</p>
<p>here, GŒºŒΩ is the Einstein tensor, which encodes the curvature of spacetime. TŒºŒΩ is the energy-momentum tensor, which represents the distribution of matter and energy. the symbols G and c are the gravitational constant and the speed of light, respectively, and œÄ is 3. while technically more complex, just think about how beautifully an equation represents some essential part of the universe.</p>
<p>when they can be solved, they provide insight into the behavior of gravitational fields, such as those around stars, galaxies, and black holes. cool stuffs.</p>
<p>one of the most famous solutions to einstein&rsquo;s equations is the schwarzschild solution, which describes spacetime outside a spherical, non-rotating mass like a star or a black hole. the solutions to these equations are at the heart of our understanding of cosmology and the large scale structure of the universe. plus, it&rsquo;s just really cool. i wish i had a lifetime to dedicate in service for this.</p>
<hr>
<p>but yes, space is pretty cool. i just want to know what my role in the universe is.</p>
<p>until an asteroid,  <br>

			 <p>i was trying to think of a slogan for myself and this would have to be it (for now).</p>
<p>putting one foot in front of the other embodies the essence of progress, representing a steady and deliberate movement forward, no matter how slow or arduous or depressed the path may be. we are our own pathfinders.</p>
<p>life, like walking (or running), often requires us to face challenges, obstacles, uphill climbs (plenty of those). yet, lets consciously choose to put one foot in front of the other. to create opportunity out of dirt.</p>
<p>it represents perserverance. it represents resilience, persistence, and an unwavering commitment to our goals. it is a reminder that even the longest journey starts with a single step: that our journey is made up of many small, determined actions.</p>
<p>it is a testament to the human spirit&rsquo;s capacity to navigate adversity, to keep moving forward, even when the end of the journey is not in sight. with curiosity as our fuel, we are travelers, making our way in this world.</p>

			 <p>what is friend.</p>
<p>meadows of laughter, slopes of jest,
walks he, immersed in solitude, bored, but no rest,
in frolicking crowds, amidst jovial delight,
a connection that lacks, a spark without light.
there are that smiles that glow, and eyes that shine,
realms of warmth; none are mine
the words they say, the tales they share,
to me: a hollow echo, in the vacant air.</p>
<p>i need an emotional link, a tether unseen,
beyond stupid shared interests, or places we&rsquo;ve been.
an understanding that delves past the skin,
to the shared human experience, dwelling within.
so, to the stars, my silent plea,
a friend, a confidant, to help me see,
a painting of life, the colors blend,
and drawn is the meaning of (friend).</p>

			 <p>a while ago, someone showed me their friend&rsquo;s <a href="https://blog-sladuca.vercel.app/posts/dragons">blog post</a> about dragons.</p>
<p>the idea of dragons are those people that always seem to not just be better than you, but seem to be unreachable‚Äîon another plane. i really liked the post and it somewhat deeply resonated with me.</p>
<p>i have this problem too, but just slightly different. in life, there is a pinnacle in any field. these are the top, undisputed people in the field. we&rsquo;ll use the example of chess: the grandmasters and super grandmasters of chess.</p>
<p>however, i price my pinnacles at the level which purely effort can take me. this is to delineate a goal for me. the people that i think are the dragons. of course, other people differ. even super-gms defer to magnus carlsen (standing above the competition by 50 elo FIDE rating, whereas 2nd-3rd place is a margin of only 5).</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ve realized, these pinnacles are still extremely high. so high in fact‚Äîthat people believe them impossible. and rational actors don&rsquo;t attempt the impossible.  except, many of these things are do-able. very do-able. they just require thousands of hours of work.</p>
<p>i want to be at the pinnacle at everything i enjoy doing. with the important caveat that it makes sense to pursue it. as long as i tried my absolute hardest, then it was a good effort.</p>
<hr>
<p>however, most people also forget they are unique. everyone has their own subset of experiences they experience. you&rsquo;d be surprised at just how rare some things are: how rare you are. the key to becoming a dragon (excluding pure genetic/nurture background types, although that counts as unique too) is to utilise these experiences. make your experiences build on each other.</p>
<p>i was watching a few startup interviews and what ticked was the surprising position some of these founders were in. a construction worker that learned to code could build a billion dollar business combining the two industries. only when you have that insight at the pinnacle of each field can you see what should be obvious. you can see things other people miss. it&rsquo;s like magic. anyone can perform magic. i truly believe this.</p>
<hr>
<p>still, i wanna be a dragon. it&rsquo;s not jealousy. it&rsquo;s just the fact that i&rsquo;m not reaching my full potential. i want to fly. it&rsquo;d be such a waste to have never felt the air under my wings.</p>
<p>okay, it&rsquo;s jealousy too and some regret. jealousy that other people took up the grind and regret that i gave up too early. the temporary dopamine is nice, but yknow i absolutely live for that delayed gratification.</p>
<p>see you sometime, <br>
rushhour</p>

			 <p>emergent gameplay is my favorite type of gameplay in video games, by far. it&rsquo;s also one of my favorite things about life in general, but we&rsquo;ll get to that later.</p>
<p>warning: long-winded and not too organized (and a bit nonsensical), but passionate!</p>
<p>emergent gameplay (like emergent properties) occurs when simple (or complex) rules work together to create new, unexpected outcomes. i also group things like meta-breaking, easter eggs, and experimental gameplay into here.</p>
<p>the core enjoyment for me here is multiplayer, with human interactions creating immense emergent options, and i cite Dota 2 and Team Fortress 2 as the best example. Dota 2 of course has a single map, but more than a hundred heroes and hundreds of skills. by quick maths, that&rsquo;s ((123! / (5! (123 - 5)!)) * (118! / (5! (118 - 5)!)))/2 unique 5v5 hero combinations. that&rsquo;s 18 quadrillion drafts. and that&rsquo;s not to mention the same combinations have even more possible ways to play them out. and of course the expansive item shop, and talent system, and map workings. even the user created arcade (and minigames) have immensely fun stuff come out of it (like the entire auto-battling genre, and my personal favorite, overthrow). there are even heroes that can copy the skills of other heroes&hellip; immensely fun. basically infinite combinations. always a new situation.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6GAiMLaYmjo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>for Team Fortress 2, the interactions and wide variety of weapons along with the 16v16 close nature of the game leads to insanely fun mechanics, such as demoknights, a billion ways to spawn camp, rocket jumping, trickstabs, sentry gun locations, duo medics, etc.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R-78OIlv0Xk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Noita is another fascinating showcase as well, but is, of course, singleplayer. it just throws in a bunch of elementary spells and equipment and ways to combine and mix them (like a programming language) and you can go all out. usually, it is quite hard to balance these sort of games, and Noita makes no attempt to. don&rsquo;t forget about the falling sand engine it&rsquo;s based off of&hellip; literally pixel by pixel interactions to create an epic emergent simulation.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sdmmf6QFYX8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Path of Exile, its passive tree and skill gems, also embody this well. Gradually emergent gameplay is how even the most casual of players fall in love with complexity. small, easy skills. one or two choices. then harder, complex, and more variety. i love these types of games. you can kill galaxy destroying gods with a self-explosion build, or a ring of fire while you afk, or a chain reaction of elements, or min-max with 1 hp, or any other wild combination of things. not to mention the extremely fun and time-consuming crafting system which just completes the game. and leads to loot explosions. i love loot.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c_WAAILY_eY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>then there&rsquo;s the element of breaking the game‚Äînonlinear gameplay, such as choosing to kill or spare Bleda the Hun in AOE2, fun mechanics like finding ways to kill your sims in Sims or pushing your enemies to death in Swords and Sandals. it is similar to easter eggs, but these are actionable and optionally part of core gameplay. this type of gameplay punches above its weight, and elevates games.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YxH_ziCiK-c" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>then, there&rsquo;s the experimental behavior of games, like Superliminal‚Äôs resizing feature. it can be items or mechanics like the Portal Gun. It can be new genres like battle royale and it can be an old genre with a new spin. it can be mods, texture packs, or shaders. it is being experimental only because it is new, but crucially it is no excuse for bad gameplay. this is what players exclaim to their friends about. it just takes a slight spin to create something amazing. minecraft hunger games led to battle royale. a small spin on mafia and twitch popularity led to among us. small, unrelated things can be just the right ingredients for something amazing.</p>

<hr>
<p>emergent gameplay is my absolute favorite mechanic, if we can call it that. outside of games, it stands alongside other (albeit simpler) principles i enjoy, like the butterfly effect or the golden rule.</p>
<p>this is why when companies lose money on end and people clamor for their end, they don&rsquo;t understand the simple brilliance of emergent discoveries in their business models. it&rsquo;s a quantifiable (but hard to quantify) metric. magic is priced-in.</p>
<p>when web-novel authors introduced pay ahead for chapters, webtoons took that and ran with it. when the gig economy started, people laughed and laughed. and then it blew up. and the sharing economy. and bitcoin and crypto.</p>
<p>in hindsight people point out that food delivery worked because people had phones now. no, it worked because of a million other reasons. mostly unintentional. they originally paid their own drivers, but then they realized they could just take the tipping culture and take advantage of it. only chinese and pizza places were capable of takeout, and they said restaurants wouldn&rsquo;t sign up. however, restaurants adapted; they were perfectly willing to, but they just didn&rsquo;t even think it was possible. they added on service fees and subscriptions, when originally people would&rsquo;ve been outraged. some of it is natural, some of it is them creating a solution to their own problem, but regardless, it is emergent. and it is brilliant.</p>
<p>sometimes, you don&rsquo;t worry about whether it will work. you just go and build it. and be ready to pivot, because you could come across the most serendipitous of discoveries.</p>
<p>HOWEVER.</p>
<p>while i like games with this sort of emergence and i really find interesting how this type of stuff comes about in real life, i do not particularly abide by this principle myself. it is just too rare to come across, so relying purely on that is foolish.</p>
<p>in the market you work in hard maths and concrete principles. in chess, the cardinal rule is not to expect your opponent to make any particular move. in love, you cannot just wish for it to work out. in reality, hard work, cleverness, and perseverance can make it work most of the time.</p>
<p>but those truly brilliant moments come unexpected and often from the arrangement of unrelated, simple things.</p>
<p>a fun rule of thumb is that say you were given the initial state and asked if the final outcome was even imaginable. if it can be even be dreamed up, then it is not emergent.</p>
<p>emergent properties are the outcomes that are beyond even our wildest dreams.</p>

<p>relatively easy,</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s an outer main ring and an inside portion. positioning (hard-coded, but not too hard to make dynamic) the inner layers makes for the 3d effect (purely visual sprites).</p>
<p>magic is in the cubic-bezier curve defined by four parameters, 2:2, time:position states. inside and outside parts are synced. we use colored svg paths so we can switch the colors up easily. keyframes to smooth and delineate our angles.</p>
