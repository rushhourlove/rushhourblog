				"title": "monopoly thoughts",
				"content_html": "<p>played monopoly, pretty realistic game huh</p>\n<p>i want to examine big tech&rsquo;s role in aspects like monopoly as well as manipulative anticompetitive and antitrust breaches. i&rsquo;m not particularly well-versed in legal nuances, but these are my opinions nonetheless.</p>\n<p>my opinion is that big tech (like many industries) has evolved dramatically in a way to allow them to cover a wide range of technologies such that they are considered a monopoly in practice, but not name. technology has enabled these companies to rapidly expand, gain control, and cement themselves in specific and related fields previously not possible before the advent of the internet.</p>\n<p>big tech is defined as the most prolific and dominant technology companies in each of their sectors, primarily <strong>software</strong> companies. antitrust relates to the legislative powers that are responsible for preventing trusts and monopolies in order to promote competition. big tech companies are described as last movers: the last company in their space. peter thiel, founder of Paypal and Palantir, and premier asshole, frequently mentions how these companies always start as a competitor in a small but growing niche, but eventually gain a large majority in the field and maintains that lead continually and artificially. however the distinction i think - the methods they employ, such as leaving competitors alive but not thriving, expanding into related industries, curbing small startups, etc. are much more nefarious, harder to prevent, and legally unclear.</p>\n<p>the largest technology companies, both consumer and enterprise, have similar paths of business growth.  apple started with a minimally designed computer, microsoft made a simple operating system, google was a search engine, facebook is a social networking site, and amazon aggregated books on the internet. each of these companies went into a relatively niche, but growing market. after cementing themselves as the leader in the field, most of these companies have never lost their market share after many years of operation. their start is not particularly unfair.</p>\n<p>the problem therein lies when big tech eventually gains a monopoly in their field and expands into multiple sectors. software is a particularly interesting technological innovation in that it is interconnected with other pieces of software. while traditionally, this may constitute common traits of a monopoly, software tends to find links that escape this view. alphabet’s start with search engines led to a natural growth towards being an advertising platform. with their acquisition of youtube, alphabet strongly grew their advertising platform subsequently.</p>\n<p>apple created the premier smartphone, but their app store nets them 30% of all digital revenue generated on more than half the mobile devices in america. apple creates other devices like headphones that link to their other software and hardware. microsoft’s cloud software, azure, works primarily on pc. their office software is similarly limited to their operating system. they find ways to interconnect their software, such that reliance on one promotes another. it creates a web of dependencies that are very difficult to untangle. this is due to the fact that software is generally expandable and skills are transferable. software is too vast a field for any one company to gain a monopoly, but fragmented enough that companies can gain monopolies in many segments. look at google’s work on mapping the world with Google Maps intertwining with their self-driving car startup, waymo. they would be able to gain a tremendous lead, unexpectedly, and instantaneously, such that legal actions and competitors wouldn’t be able to catch up.</p>\n<p>legal definitions are difficult. google no longer defines themselves as a search engine company. they may be a monopoly in that sector, but if they classify themselves as an advertising company, then their market penetration is minimal. apple has a large majority market share in America, but loses to android internationally. amazon is the largest e-commerce site by far, but loses spectacularly to retail. software is interconnected with other internet spaces and physical premises, but definitions are loose. antitrust laws just do not define any of the technical terms precisely enough. google is a search engine, but more searches occur generally on the internet. arguably, amazon’s search on their platform generates even more revenue than Google. deliberation between these concepts and terms are necessary if antitrust regulations want to catch up.</p>\n<p>in every sector, companies always have “competition.” From local to large, companies precipitate on weak competitors. locally in their domain, it is almost inarguable that a monopoly exists for most of these companies. google has embedded itself into American culture so much so that searching is called “googling.” bing, firefox, or internet explorer is only used for specific use cases and individuals. amazon is by far the largest ecommerce company, but sites like shopify, ebay, or etsy can be considered competitors. these companies know they have dominance, but leave smaller competitors alone to not be considered monopolies. a famous historical example is ofc microsoft funding apple’s new products in its early stage so they could prop up another competitor.</p>\n<p>another issue of participation is that big tech is in many fields which leads to a false sense of competition. google may have search engine dominance, but they also compete in other fields like cloud computing, advertising, social media, hardware, and infrastructure. many of the other large software companies compete in these same exact industries. this overlap prevents any one company from gaining a vast majority of the share of the market in all of the fields. no one incumbent technology stack allows expandable control into other fields. but, despite that, some companies can maintain a lead and others hold on but never thrive. aws leads cloud, but other companies can compete due to their massive amounts of capital, but that doesn’t mean aws won’t lead cloud for the next decade. a web of software companies competing in the same fields leads to competition defined as any software company. google is compared to facebook and not bing. amazon is compared to microsoft and not other online retailers. no one company can be considered a monopoly because software is just so large. while this may indicate that these companies are not necessarily software monopolies, it is still quite clear that it eliminates smaller competition, such as smaller companies and startups.</p>\n<p>tech builds horizontally. this means infrastructure, technology, and patents are structured to be developed deep in their field. amazon relies heavily on their servers. apple needs its hardware supply chain control. google’s complex algorithms optimize search. facebook’s pool of data is unmatched.</p>\n<p>further, for most software companies, it is working capital and quick acquisition ability that allows them to retain control while skidding federal guidelines. for aspiring startups, like myself, larger companies can simply acquire them. an aggregation of these companies is particularly difficult to prevent.  microsoft has bought up a variety of game studios for their gaming platform. facebook has capital to buy upcoming social media platforms. amazon acquires many smaller marketplaces. while this is applicable in any industry, it is especially true for technology companies because so many of them are quick and stealthy acquisitions. there are many acquisitions that go under public or regulatory scrutiny as they are only required to disclose the biggest deals. it looks like any deal smaller than $90 million can go undisclosed, which applies to the majority of acquisitions, and with the significantly easily scalable nature of software, these companies can grow to become tremendous assets. further, hundreds of acquisitions can be more impactful than a singular purchase, but still go ignored. their massive market valuations allow them to buy companies that are not “material” or help them secure impressive employees or patents. even larger deals bypass authorities like facebook’s billion dollar acquisitions of instagram and whatsapp. something here about the large cash flows of big tech, lack of legal definitions for software, and the FTC’s minimal funding and resources contribute to big tech’s infallibility.</p>\n<p>another issue i see often is the development of software as a platform. While individual software can grow large, platforms allow the integration of smaller entities and users. apple’s app store is a good example of a private platform that may grow too large. it is simply unreasonable to ask 30% for all digital transactions from their platform. there is a discussion to be had when a private platform should be publicly opened up. in may, 2021, a few years ago, a significant case, epic games v. apple, will force apple to change its anti-steering laws that restricted all external payment options. the growth of platforms and the ability to embed code allows for unfair control of data, payments, and market share that is simply going to be impossible to compete with at any scale. for example, in china, tencent’s wechat messaging app currently has the ability to create ‘micro-apps’ inside the app that allow users to interact with other software for shopping or eating. through WeChat, users can order food, shop online, find tesla chargers, play games, chat with friends, and do almost anything. the development of super-platforms can be dangerous as companies grow larger and have more influence.</p>\n<p>there is also a growing reliance from consumers for software. at some point software becomes more entangled with daily life and operations that it is almost necessary to have them. in some instances, social media is necessary for individuals to connect to others. there could be a psychological dependence on some of these apps. unlike other necessities, however, software can’t be logically broken up. after all, some software is purposely designed to aggregate fragmented markets. splitting up amazon’s ecommerce platform wouldn’t make sense as it’s original purpose was to combine retailers. it would be too drastic a change that regulators would have to find alternative options that might not logically or easily exist.</p>\n<p>similarly, there is also a dependency of enterprise to software. many businesses, small and large, depend on software. it is telling that much of the fortune 500 is unable to develop in-house solutions for things like content-management systems, cloud storage, or hr.</p>\n<p>imagine smaller businesses. companies like doordash grow their hold on small business restaurants. restaurant margins are difficult already, but doordash adds a 30% commission fee, and forces restaurants to use their point of sale and advertising systems. without more competition, restaurants are forced to engage with these ludicrous fees in order to survive. however, competitors can’t arise because companies like dd and ue require large fleets to work. further, they all have similarly large fees with no regulation to push much of it down. it sounds eerily similar to the utility industries, but there is no classification for any of these software companies.</p>\n<p>many of these companies can create irreparably disastrous effects on society. we have already seen Facebook’s engagement algorithms create outrage for things like vaccines or politics. facebook’s purchase of oculus and their subsequent rebrand to meta can be dangerous as facebook may eventually gain control of the vast majority of the virtual reality market and the data collection associated with that. there have been many instances of aws, which one-third of the internet approximately runs on, shutting down periodically, losing billions of dollars for companies and losing essential services for people. there is also a history of companies curbing innovation in general to maintain the status quo, whether by outpricing competitors, or buying them out and shutting them down. in the future, there is also the potential for companies like microsoft’s hold on ai and machine learning to create artificial intelligence on a scale that humans or other companies cannot compete with in any capacity.</p>\n<p>i took a quick look at oustide america, to other countries since the legal systems and standards are quite different. the european union stringently tries to implement antitrust practices that allow for cheap consumer prices, consumer protection, and ensures companies have low barriers to entry. there is a case going on where amazon is being accused of using its merchant data to compete unfairly. for example, amazon has a program called amazon basics which has almost identical designs to similar top-selling items, but at drastically cheaper prices due to amazon’s supply chain logistics. furthermore, while software is global, usage of funds is not. many tech companies use state aid from other countries in operations elsewhere in order to grow, which can give them significant advantages over other companies. the german federal cartel office forced facebook to stop collecting data without consent, since the mass collection of data is reasonably insurmountable. there is also a growing trend of creating a way to regulate big tech activities before they happen. the issue here is that bt can create software innovations across industries significantly faster than new laws can be set, so there needs to be a uniform way to detect or limit these abuses. china has fined companies billions for exclusivity deals. it has also separated payment platforms and products for ant group, similar to the epic games v. apple case. however, ofc, china’s motives may be more dubious, as many of these restrictions occurred to jack ma, founder of alibaba, after he made negative remarks towards china.</p>\n<p>meh we&rsquo;re screwed</p>\n",

consumer and enterprise, have similar paths of business growth.  apple started with a minimally designed computer, microsoft made a simple operating system, google was a search engine, facebook is a social networking site, and amazon aggregated books on the internet. each of these companies went into a relatively niche, but growing market. after cementing themselves as the leader in the field, most of these companies have never lost their market share after many years of operation. their start is not particularly unfair.\n\nthe problem therein lies when big tech eventually gains a monopoly in their field and expands into multiple sectors. software is a particularly interesting technological innovation in that it is interconnected with other pieces of software. while traditionally, this may constitute common traits of a monopoly, software tends to find links that escape this view. alphabet’s start with search engines led to a natural growth towards being an advertising platform. with their acquisition of youtube, alphabet strongly grew their advertising platform subsequently. \n\napple created the premier smartphone, but their app store nets them 30% of all digital revenue generated on more than half the mobile devices in america. apple creates other devices like headphones that link to their other software and hardware. microsoft’s cloud software, azure, works primarily on pc. their office software is similarly limited to their operating system. they find ways to interconnect their software, such that reliance on one promotes another. it creates a web of dependencies that are very difficult to untangle. this is due to the fact that software is generally expandable and skills are transferable. software is too vast a field for any one company to gain a monopoly, but fragmented enough that companies can gain monopolies in many segments. look at google’s work on mapping the world with Google Maps intertwining with their self-driving car startup, waymo. they would be able to gain a tremendous lead, unexpectedly, and instantaneously, such that legal actions and competitors wouldn’t be able to catch up.\n\nlegal definitions are difficult. google no longer defines themselves as a search engine company. they may be a monopoly in that sector, but if they classify themselves as an advertising company, then their market penetration is minimal. apple has a large majority market share in America, but loses to android internationally. amazon is the largest e-commerce site by far, but loses spectacularly to retail. software is interconnected with other internet spaces and physical premises, but definitions are loose. antitrust laws just do not define any of the technical terms precisely enough. google is a search engine, but more searches occur generally on the internet. arguably, amazon’s search on their platform generates even more revenue than Google. deliberation between these concepts and terms are necessary if antitrust regulations want to catch up.\n\nin every sector, companies always have “competition.” From local to large, companies precipitate on weak competitors. locally in their domain, it is almost inarguable that a monopoly exists for most of these companies. google has embedded itself into American culture so much so that searching is called “googling.” bing, firefox, or internet explorer is only used for specific use cases and individuals. amazon is by far the largest ecommerce company, but sites like shopify, ebay, or etsy can be considered competitors. these companies know they have dominance, but leave smaller competitors alone to not be considered monopolies. a famous historical example is ofc microsoft funding apple’s new products in its early stage so they could prop up another competitor. \n\nanother issue of participation is that big tech is in many fields which leads to a false sense of competition. google may have search engine dominance, but they also compete in other fields like cloud computing, advertising, social media, hardware, and infrastructure. many of the other large software companies compete in these same exact industries. this overlap prevents any one company from gaining a vast majority of the share of the market in all of the fields. no one incumbent technology stack allows expandable control into other fields. but, despite that, some companies can maintain a lead and others hold on but never thrive. aws leads cloud, but other companies can compete due to their massive amounts of capital, but that doesn’t mean aws won’t lead cloud for the next decade. a web of software companies competing in the same fields leads to competition defined as any software company. google is compared to facebook and not bing. amazon is compared to microsoft and not other online retailers. no one company can be considered a monopoly because software is just so large. while this may indicate that these companies are not necessarily software monopolies, it is still quite clear that it eliminates smaller competition, such as smaller companies and startups.\n\ntech builds horizontally. this means infrastructure, technology, and patents are structured to be developed deep in their field. amazon relies heavily on their servers. apple needs its hardware supply chain control. google’s complex algorithms optimize search. facebook’s pool of data is unmatched. \n\nfurther, for most software companies, it is working capital and quick acquisition ability that allows them to retain control while skidding federal guidelines. for aspiring startups, like myself, larger companies can simply acquire them. an aggregation of these companies is particularly difficult to prevent.  microsoft has bought up a variety of game studios for their gaming platform. facebook has capital to buy upcoming social media platforms. amazon acquires many smaller marketplaces. while this is applicable in any industry, it is especially true for technology companies because so many of them are quick and stealthy acquisitions. there are many acquisitions that go under public or regulatory scrutiny as they are only required to disclose the biggest deals. it looks like any deal smaller than $90 million can go undisclosed, which applies to the majority of acquisitions, and with the significantly easily scalable nature of software, these companies can grow to become tremendous assets. further, hundreds of acquisitions can be more impactful than a singular purchase, but still go ignored. their massive market valuations allow them to buy companies that are not “material” or help them secure impressive employees or patents. even larger deals bypass authorities like facebook’s billion dollar acquisitions of instagram and whatsapp. something here about the large cash flows of big tech, lack of legal definitions for software, and the FTC’s minimal funding and resources contribute to big tech’s infallibility. \n\nanother issue i see often is the development of software as a platform. While individual software can grow large, platforms allow the integration of smaller entities and users. apple’s app store is a good example of a private platform that may grow too large. it is simply unreasonable to ask 30% for all digital transactions from their platform. there is a discussion to be had when a private platform should be publicly opened up. in may, 2021, a few years ago, a significant case, epic games v. apple, will force apple to change its anti-steering laws that restricted all external payment options. the growth of platforms and the ability to embed code allows for unfair control of data, payments, and market share that is simply going to be impossible to compete with at any scale. for example, in china, tencent’s wechat messaging app currently has the ability to create ‘micro-apps’ inside the app that allow users to interact with other software for shopping or eating. through WeChat, users can order food, shop online, find tesla chargers, play games, chat with friends, and do almost anything. the development of super-platforms can be dangerous as companies grow larger and have more influence.\n\nthere is also a growing reliance from consumers for software. at some point software becomes more entangled with daily life and operations that it is almost necessary to have them. in some instances, social media is necessary for individuals to connect to others. there could be a psychological dependence on some of these apps. unlike other necessities, however, software can’t be logically broken up. after all, some software is purposely designed to aggregate fragmented markets. splitting up amazon’s ecommerce platform wouldn’t make sense as it’s original purpose was to combine retailers. it would be too drastic a change that regulators would have to find alternative options that might not logically or easily exist. \n\nsimilarly, there is also a dependency of enterprise to software. many businesses, small and large, depend on software. it is telling that much of the fortune 500 is unable to develop in-house solutions for things like content-management systems, cloud storage, or hr. \n\nimagine smaller businesses. companies like doordash grow their hold on small business restaurants. restaurant margins are difficult already, but doordash adds a 30% commission fee, and forces restaurants to use their point of sale and advertising systems. without more competition, restaurants are forced to engage with these ludicrous fees in order to survive. however, competitors can’t arise because companies like dd and ue require large fleets to work. further, they all have similarly large fees with no regulation to push much of it down. it sounds eerily similar to the utility industries, but there is no classification for any of these software companies.\n\nmany of these companies can create irreparably disastrous effects on society. we have already seen Facebook’s engagement algorithms create outrage for things like vaccines or politics. facebook’s purchase of oculus and their subsequent rebrand to meta can be dangerous as facebook may eventually gain control of the vast majority of the virtual reality market and the data collection associated with that. there have been many instances of aws, which one-third of the internet approximately runs on, shutting down periodically, losing billions of dollars for companies and losing essential services for people. there is also a history of companies curbing innovation in general to maintain the status quo, whether by outpricing competitors, or buying them out and shutting them down. in the future, there is also the potential for companies like microsoft’s hold on ai and machine learning to create artificial intelligence on a scale that humans or other companies cannot compete with in any capacity.\n \ni took a quick look at oustide america, to other countries since the legal systems and standards are quite different. the european union stringently tries to implement antitrust practices that allow for cheap consumer prices, consumer protection, and ensures companies have low barriers to entry. there is a case going on where amazon is being accused of using its merchant data to compete unfairly. for example, amazon has a program called amazon basics which has almost identical designs to similar top-selling items, but at drastically cheaper prices due to amazon’s supply chain logistics. furthermore, while software is global, usage of funds is not. many tech companies use state aid from other countries in operations elsewhere in order to grow, which can give them significant advantages over other companies. the german federal cartel office forced facebook to stop collecting data without consent, since the mass collection of data is reasonably insurmountable. there is also a growing trend of creating a way to regulate big tech activities before they happen. the issue here is that bt can create software innovations across industries significantly faster than new laws can be set, so there needs to be a uniform way to detect or limit these abuses. china has fined companies billions for exclusivity deals. it has also separated payment platforms and products for ant group, similar to the epic games v. apple case. however, ofc, china’s motives may be more dubious, as many of these restrictions occurred to jack ma, founder of alibaba, after he made negative remarks towards china.\n\nmeh we're screwed\n\n\n",

Dota 2 of course has a single map, but more than a hundred heroes and hundreds of skills. by quick maths, that&rsquo;s ((123! / (5! (123 - 5)!)) * (118! / (5! (118 - 5)!)))/2 unique 5v5 hero combinations. that&rsquo;s 18 quadrillion drafts. and that&rsquo;s not to mention the same combinations have even more possible ways to play them out. and of course the expansive item shop, and talent system, and map workings. even the user created arcade (and minigames) have immensely fun stuff come out of it (like the entire auto-battling genre, and my personal favorite, overthrow). there are even heroes that can copy the skills of other heroes&hellip; immensely fun. basically infinite combinations. always a new situation.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>for Team Fortress 2, the interactions and wide variety of weapons along with the 16v16 close nature of the game leads to insanely fun mechanics, such as demoknights, a billion ways to spawn camp, rocket jumping, trickstabs, sentry gun locations, duo medics, etc.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Noita is another fascinating showcase as well, but is, of course, singleplayer. it just throws in a bunch of elementary spells and equipment and ways to combine and mix them (like a programming language) and you can go all out. usually, it is quite hard to balance these sort of games, and Noita makes no attempt to. don&rsquo;t forget about the falling sand engine it&rsquo;s based off of&hellip; literally pixel by pixel interactions to create an epic emergent simulation.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Path of Exile, its passive tree and skill gems, also embody this well. Gradually emergent gameplay is how even the most casual of players fall in love with complexity. small, easy skills. one or two choices. then harder, complex, and more variety. i love these types of games. you can kill galaxy destroying gods with a self-explosion build, or a ring of fire while you afk, or a chain reaction of elements, or min-max with 1 hp, or any other wild combination of things. not to mention the extremely fun and time-consuming crafting system which just completes the game. and leads to loot explosions. i love loot.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>then there&rsquo;s the element of breaking the game—nonlinear gameplay, such as choosing to kill or spare Bleda the Hun in AOE2, fun mechanics like finding ways to kill your sims in Sims or pushing your enemies to death in Swords and Sandals. it is similar to easter eggs, but these are actionable and optionally part of core gameplay. this type of gameplay punches above its weight, and elevates games.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>then, there&rsquo;s the experimental behavior of games, like Superliminal’s resizing feature. it can be items or mechanics like the Portal Gun. It can be new genres like battle royale and it can be an old genre with a new spin. it can be mods, texture packs, or shaders. it is being experimental only because it is new, but crucially it is no excuse for bad gameplay. this is what players exclaim to their friends about. it just takes a slight spin to create something amazing. minecraft hunger games led to battle royale. a small spin on mafia and twitch popularity led to among us. small, unrelated things can be just the right ingredients for something amazing.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<hr>\n<p>emergent gameplay is my absolute favorite mechanic, if we can call it that. outside of games, it stands alongside other (albeit simpler) principles i enjoy, like the butterfly effect or the golden rule.</p>\n<p>this is why when companies lose money on end and people clamor for their end, they don&rsquo;t understand the simple brilliance of emergent discoveries in their business models. it&rsquo;s a quantifiable (but hard to quantify) metric. magic is priced-in.</p>\n<p>when web-novel authors introduced pay ahead for chapters, webtoons took that and ran with it. when the gig economy started, people laughed and laughed. and then it blew up. and the sharing economy. and bitcoin and crypto.</p>\n<p>in hindsight people point out that food delivery worked because people had phones now. no, it worked because of a million other reasons. mostly unintentional. they originally paid their own drivers, but then they realized they could just take the tipping culture and take advantage of it. only chinese and pizza places were capable of takeout, and they said restaurants wouldn&rsquo;t sign up. however, restaurants adapted; they were perfectly willing to, but they just didn&rsquo;t even think it was possible. they added on service fees and subscriptions, when originally people would&rsquo;ve been outraged. some of it is natural, some of it is them creating a solution to their own problem, but regardless, it is emergent. and it is brilliant.</p>\n<p>sometimes, you don&rsquo;t worry about whether it will work. you just go and build it. and be ready to pivot, because you could come across the most serendipitous of discoveries.</p>\n<p>HOWEVER.</p>\n<p>while i like games with this sort of emergence and i really find interesting how this type of stuff comes about in real life, i do not particularly abide by this principle myself. it is just too rare to come across, so relying purely on that is foolish.</p>\n<p>in the market you work in hard maths and concrete principles. in chess, the cardinal rule is not to expect your opponent to make any particular move. in love, you cannot just wish for it to work out. in reality, hard work, cleverness, and perseverance can make it work most of the time.</p>\n<p>but those truly brilliant moments come unexpected and often from the arrangement of unrelated, simple things.</p>\n<p>a fun rule of thumb is that say you were given the initial state and asked if the final outcome was even imaginable. if it can be even be dreamed up, then it is not emergent.</p>\n<p>emergent properties are the outcomes that are beyond even our wildest dreams.</p>",

(118 - 5)!)))/2 unique 5v5 hero combinations. that's 18 quadrillion drafts. and that's not to mention the same combinations have even more possible ways to play them out. and of course the expansive item shop, and talent system, and map workings. even the user created arcade (and minigames) have immensely fun stuff come out of it (like the entire auto-battling genre, and my personal favorite, overthrow). there are even heroes that can copy the skills of other heroes... immensely fun. basically infinite combinations. always a new situation.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6GAiMLaYmjo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nfor Team Fortress 2, the interactions and wide variety of weapons along with the 16v16 close nature of the game leads to insanely fun mechanics, such as demoknights, a billion ways to spawn camp, rocket jumping, trickstabs, sentry gun locations, duo medics, etc. \n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/R-78OIlv0Xk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nNoita is another fascinating showcase as well, but is, of course, singleplayer. it just throws in a bunch of elementary spells and equipment and ways to combine and mix them (like a programming language) and you can go all out. usually, it is quite hard to balance these sort of games, and Noita makes no attempt to. don't forget about the falling sand engine it's based off of... literally pixel by pixel interactions to create an epic emergent simulation.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sdmmf6QFYX8\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nPath of Exile, its passive tree and skill gems, also embody this well. Gradually emergent gameplay is how even the most casual of players fall in love with complexity. small, easy skills. one or two choices. then harder, complex, and more variety. i love these types of games. you can kill galaxy destroying gods with a self-explosion build, or a ring of fire while you afk, or a chain reaction of elements, or min-max with 1 hp, or any other wild combination of things. not to mention the extremely fun and time-consuming crafting system which just completes the game. and leads to loot explosions. i love loot.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/c_WAAILY_eY\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nthen there's the element of breaking the game—nonlinear gameplay, such as choosing to kill or spare Bleda the Hun in AOE2, fun mechanics like finding ways to kill your sims in Sims or pushing your enemies to death in Swords and Sandals. it is similar to easter eggs, but these are actionable and optionally part of core gameplay. this type of gameplay punches above its weight, and elevates games. \n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YxH_ziCiK-c\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nthen, there's the experimental behavior of games, like Superliminal’s resizing feature. it can be items or mechanics like the Portal Gun. It can be new genres like battle royale and it can be an old genre with a new spin. it can be mods, texture packs, or shaders. it is being experimental only because it is new, but crucially it is no excuse for bad gameplay. this is what players exclaim to their friends about. it just takes a slight spin to create something amazing. minecraft hunger games led to battle royale. a small spin on mafia and twitch popularity led to among us. small, unrelated things can be just the right ingredients for something amazing.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JJ6vmdfdn5U\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n-----------\n\nemergent gameplay is my absolute favorite mechanic, if we can call it that. outside of games, it stands alongside other (albeit simpler) principles i enjoy, like the butterfly effect or the golden rule. \n\nthis is why when companies lose money on end and people clamor for their end, they don't understand the simple brilliance of emergent discoveries in their business models. it's a quantifiable (but hard to quantify) metric. magic is priced-in.\n\nwhen web-novel authors introduced pay ahead for chapters, webtoons took that and ran with it. when the gig economy started, people laughed and laughed. and then it blew up. and the sharing economy. and bitcoin and crypto. \n\nin hindsight people point out that food delivery worked because people had phones now. no, it worked because of a million other reasons. mostly unintentional. they originally paid their own drivers, but then they realized they could just take the tipping culture and take advantage of it. only chinese and pizza places were capable of takeout, and they said restaurants wouldn't sign up. however, restaurants adapted; they were perfectly willing to, but they just didn't even think it was possible. they added on service fees and subscriptions, when originally people would've been outraged. some of it is natural, some of it is them creating a solution to their own problem, but regardless, it is emergent. and it is brilliant.\n\nsometimes, you don't worry about whether it will work. you just go and build it. and be ready to pivot, because you could come across the most serendipitous of discoveries. \n\nHOWEVER.\n\nwhile i like games with this sort of emergence and i really find interesting how this type of stuff comes about in real life, i do not particularly abide by this principle myself. it is just too rare to come across, so relying purely on that is foolish. \n\nin the market you work in hard maths and concrete principles. in chess, the cardinal rule is not to expect your opponent to make any particular move. in love, you cannot just wish for it to work out. in reality, hard work, cleverness, and perseverance can make it work most of the time. \n\nbut those truly brilliant moments come unexpected and often from the arrangement of unrelated, simple things. \n\na fun rule of thumb is that say you were given the initial state and asked if the final outcome was even imaginable. if it can be even be dreamed up, then it is not emergent. \n\nemergent properties are the outcomes that are beyond even our wildest dreams. \n",
